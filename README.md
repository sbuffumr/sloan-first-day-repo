Sloan's First Day Repo

This is classwork for March 25th, 2024.

We learned how to clone github repos to our local repos. 

git clone <URL>
Touch creates documents
git commit -m(Messege) "Comment)
git add -A or git add . The git add . adds all changes.
git push origin main (sends back to github)

Yay, you did it!
